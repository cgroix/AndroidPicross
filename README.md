AndroidPicross
==============

A picross implementation for Android


What is it?
-----------

A small project I made some time ago, in order to introduce me to Android developement.

It is a Picross (also called Nonogram) puzzle game (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram)

What it looks like?
-------------------

A not so polished game with a few available puzzles, to use with a touchscreen device.
